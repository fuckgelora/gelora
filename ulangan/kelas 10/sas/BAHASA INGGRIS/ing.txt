Additional Information:
• Substitute for Mentai:
If you can’t find mentai sauce or mentaiko, you can make a similar sauce by mixing regular spicy mayo with a bit of fish roe or cod roe for added texture.
• Make it Spicier:
If you like a spicier kick, you can increase the amount of chili flakes or add a dash of hot sauce to the mayo sauce.
• Alternative Garnishes:
You can also garnish with pickled ginger or a sprinkle of furikake (Japanese rice seasoning) for extra flavor.

What can you use as an alternative if you can’t find mentai sauce? 	
		Tomato sauce 	
	Benar 	Spicy mayo and fish roe 	
		Regular mayonnaise 	
		Soy sauce 	
		Teriyaki sauce
